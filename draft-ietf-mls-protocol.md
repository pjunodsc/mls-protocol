--- abstract

Messaging applications are increasingly making use of end-to-end
security mechanisms to ensure that messages are only accessible to
the communicating endpoints, and not to any servers involved in delivering
messages.  Establishing keys to provide such protections is
challenging for group chat settings, in which more than two
clients need to agree on a key but may not be online at the same
time.  In this document, we specify a key establishment
protocol that provides efficient asynchronous group key establishment
with forward secrecy and post-compromise security for groups
in size ranging from two to thousands.

# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft of MLS and has not yet
seen significant security analysis. It should not be used as a basis
for building production systems.

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for
this draft is maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be
submitted as pull requests at https://github.com/mlswg/mls-protocol.
Instructions are on that page as well. Editorial changes can be
managed in GitHub, but any substantive change should be discussed on
the MLS mailing list.

A group of users who want to send each other encrypted messages needs
a way to derive shared symmetric encryption keys. For two parties,
this problem has been studied thoroughly, with the Double Ratchet
emerging as a common solution {{doubleratchet}} {{signal}}.
Channels implementing the Double Ratchet enjoy fine-grained forward secrecy
as well as post-compromise security, but are nonetheless efficient
enough for heavy use over low-bandwidth networks.

For a group of size greater than two, a common strategy is to
unilaterally broadcast symmetric "sender" keys over existing shared
symmetric channels, and then for each member to send messages to the
group encrypted with their own sender key. Unfortunately, while this
improves efficiency over pairwise broadcast of individual messages and
provides forward secrecy (with the addition of a hash ratchet),
it is difficult to achieve post-compromise security with
sender keys. An adversary who learns a sender key can often indefinitely and
passively eavesdrop on that member's messages.  Generating and
distributing a new sender key provides a form of post-compromise
security with regard to that sender.  However, it requires
computation and communications resources that scale linearly with
the size of the group.

In this document, we describe a protocol based on tree structures
that enable asynchronous group keying with forward secrecy and
post-compromise security.  Based on earlier work on "asynchronous
ratcheting trees" {{art}}, the protocol presented here uses an
asynchronous key-encapsulation mechanism for tree structures.
This mechanism allows the members of the group to derive and update
shared keys with costs that scale as the log of the group size.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

Client:
: An agent that uses this protocol to establish shared cryptographic
  state with other clients.  A client is defined by the
  cryptographic keys it holds.  An application or user may use one client
  per device (keeping keys local to each device) or sync keys among
  a user's devices so that each user appears as a single client.
  In the scenario where multiple devices share the cryptographic material
  the client is referred to as a "virtual" client.

Group:
: A collection of clients with shared cryptographic state.

Member:
: A client that is included in the shared state of a group, hence
  has access to the group's secrets.

Initialization Key:
: A short-lived HPKE key pair used to introduce a new
  client to a group.  Initialization keys are published for
  each client (ClientInitKey).

Leaf Key:
: A secret that represents a member's contribution to the group secret
  (so called because the members' leaf keys are the leaves in the
  group's ratchet tree).

Identity Key:
: A long-lived signing key pair used to authenticate the sender of a
  message.

Terminology specific to tree computations is described in
{{ratchet-trees}}.

We use the TLS presentation language {{!RFC8446}} to
describe the structure of protocol messages.


# Basic Assumptions

This protocol is designed to execute in the context of a Messaging Service (MS)
as described in [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture].  In particular, we assume
the MS provides the following services:

* A long-term identity key provider which allows clients to authenticate
  protocol messages in a group. These keys MUST be kept for the lifetime of the
  group as there is no mechanism in the protocol for changing a client's
  identity key.

* A broadcast channel, for each group, which will relay a message to all members
  of a group.  For the most part, we assume that this channel delivers messages
  in the same order to all participants.  (See {{sequencing}} for further
  considerations.)

* A directory to which clients can publish initialization keys and download
  initialization keys for other participants.


# Protocol Overview

The goal of this protocol is to allow a group of clients to exchange
confidential and authenticated messages. It does so by deriving a sequence
of secrets and keys known only to members. Those should be secret against an
active network adversary and should have both forward and post-compromise
secrecy with respect to compromise of a participant.

We describe the information stored by each client as a _state_, which
includes both public and private data. An initial state, including an initial
set of clients, is set up by a group creator using the _Init_ algorithm and
based on information pre-published by clients. The creator sends the _Init_
message to the clients, who can then set up their own group state and derive
the same shared secret. Clients then exchange messages to produce new shared
states which are causally linked to their predecessors, forming a logical
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of states.
Members can send _Update_ messages for post-compromise secrecy and new clients
can be added or existing members removed from the group.

The protocol algorithms we specify here follow. Each algorithm specifies
both (i) how a client performs the operation and (ii) how other clients
update their state based on it.

There are three major operations in the lifecycle of a group:

* Adding a member, initiated by a current member;
* Updating the leaf secret of a member;
* Removing a member.

Before the initialization of a group, clients publish ClientInitKey
objects to a directory provided to the Messaging Service.

~~~~~

When a client A wants to establish a group with B and C, it
first downloads ClientInitKeys for B and C.  It then initializes a group state
containing only itself and uses the ClientInitKeys to compute Welcome and Add
messages to add B and C, in a sequence chosen by A.  The Welcome messages are
sent directly to the new members (there is no need to send them to
the group).
The Add messages are broadcasted to the group, and processed in sequence
by B and C.  Messages received before a client has joined the
group are ignored.  Only after A has received its Add messages
back from the server does it update its state to reflect their addition.

~~~~~

Subsequent additions of group members proceed in the same way.  Any
member of the group can download an ClientInitKey for a new client
and broadcast an Add message that the current group can use to update
their state and the new client can use to initialize its state.

To enforce forward secrecy and post-compromise security of messages,
each member periodically updates its leaf secret which represents
its contribution to the group secret.  Any member of the
group can send an Update at any time by generating a fresh leaf secret
and sending an Update message that describes how to update the
group secret with that new information.  Once all members have
processed this message, the group's secrets will be unknown to an
attacker that had compromised the sender's prior leaf secret.

It is left to the application to determine the interval of time between
Update messages. This policy could require a change for each message, or
it could require sending an update every week or more.

~~~~~

Members are removed from the group in a similar way, as an update
is effectively removing the old leaf from the group.
Any member of the group can generate a Remove message that adds new
entropy to the group state that is known to all members except the
removed member.  After other participants have processed this message,
the group's secrets will be unknown to the removed participant.
Note that this does not necessarily imply that any member
is actually allowed to evict other members; groups can layer
authentication-based access control policies on top of these
basic mechanism.

# Ratchet Trees

The protocol uses "ratchet trees" for deriving shared secrets among
a group of clients.

## Tree Computation Terminology

Trees consist of _nodes_. A node is a
_leaf_ if it has no children, and a _parent_ otherwise; note that all
parents in our trees have precisely
two children, a _left_ child and a _right_ child. A node is the _root_
of a tree if it has no parents, and _intermediate_ if it has both
children and parents. The _descendants_ of a node are that node, its
children, and the descendants of its children, and we say a tree
_contains_ a node if that node is a descendant of the root of the
tree. Nodes are _siblings_ if they share the same parent.

A _subtree_ of a tree is the tree given by the descendants of any
node, the _head_ of the subtree. The _size_ of a tree or subtree is the
number of leaf nodes it contains.  For a given parent node, its _left
subtree_ is the subtree with its left child as head (respectively
_right subtree_).

All trees used in this protocol are left-balanced binary trees. A
binary tree is _full_ (and _balanced_) if its size is a power of
two and for any parent node in the tree, its left and right subtrees
have the same size. If a subtree is full and it is not a subset of
any other full subtree, then it is _maximal_.

A binary tree is _left-balanced_ if for every
parent, either the parent is balanced, or the left subtree of that
parent is the largest full subtree that could be constructed from
the leaves present in the parent's own subtree.  Note
that given a list of `n` items, there is a unique left-balanced
binary tree structure with these elements as leaves.  In such a
left-balanced tree, the `k-th` leaf node refers to the `k-th` leaf
node in the tree when counting from the left, starting from 0.

The _direct path_ of a root is the empty list, and of any other node
is the concatenation of that node with the direct path of its
parent. The _copath_ of a node is the list of siblings of nodes in its
direct path. The _frontier_ of a tree is the list of heads of the maximal
full subtrees of the tree, ordered from left to right.

For example, in the below tree:

* The direct path of C is (C, CD, ABCD)
* The copath of C is (D, AB, EFG)
* The frontier of the tree is (ABCD, EF, G)

~~~~~
            ABCDEFG
           /      \
          /        \
         /          \
     ABCD            EFG
    /    \          /  \
   /      \        /    \
  AB      CD      EF    |
 / \     / \     / \    |
A   B   C   D   E   F   G

                    1 1 1
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2
~~~~~

Each node in the tree is assigned a _node index_, starting at zero and
running from left to right.  A node is a leaf node if and only if it
has an even index.  The node indices for the nodes in the above tree
are as follows:

* 0 = A
* 1 = AB
* 2 = B
* 3 = ABCD
* 4 = C
* 5 = CD
* 6 = D
* 7 = ABCDEFG
* 8 = E
* 9 = EF
* 10 = F
* 11 = EFG
* 12 = G

(Note that left-balanced binary trees are the same structure that is
used for the Merkle trees in the Certificate Transparency protocol
{{?I-D.ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis}}.)

The leaves of the tree are indexed separately, using a _leaf index_,
since the protocol messages only need to refer to leaves in the
tree.  Like nodes, leaves are numbered left to right.  Note that
given the above numbering, a node is a leaf node if and only if it
has an even node index, and a leaf node's leaf index is half its
node index.  The leaf indices in the above tree are as follows:

* 0 = A
* 1 = B
* 2 = C
* 3 = D
* 4 = E
* 5 = F
* 6 = G

## Ratchet Tree Nodes

A particular instance of a ratchet tree is based on the following
cryptographic primitives, defined by the ciphersuite in use:

* An HPKE ciphersuite, which specifies a Key Encapsulation Method
  (KEM), an AEAD encryption scheme, and a hash function
* A Derive-Key-Pair function that produces an asymmetric key pair
  for the specified KEM from a symmetric secret, using the specified
  hash function.

Each node in a ratchet tree contains up to three values:

* A private key (only within direct path, see below)
* A public key
* A credential (only for leaf nodes)

The conditions under which each of these values must or must not be
present are laid out in {{views}}.

A node in the tree may also be _blank_, indicating that no value is
present at that node.  The _resolution_ of a node is an ordered list
of non-blank nodes that collectively cover all non-blank descendants
of the node.  The nodes in a resolution are ordered according to
their indices.

* The resolution of a non-blank node is a one element list
  containing the node itself
* The resolution of a blank leaf node is the empty list
* The resolution of a blank intermediate node is the result of
  concatinating the resolution of its left child with the resolution
  of its right child, in that order

For example, consider the following tree, where the "\_" character
represents a blank node:

~~~~~
      _
    /   \
   /     \
  _       CD
 / \     / \
A   _   C   D

0 1 2 3 4 5 6
~~~~~

In this tree, we can see all three of the above rules in play:

* The resolution of node 5 is the list [CD]
* The resolution of node 2 is the empty list []
* The resolution of node 3 is the list [A, CD]

Every node, regardless of whether a node is blank or populated, has
a corresponding _hash_ that summarizes the contents of the subtree
below that node.  The rules for computing these hashes are described
in {{tree-hashes}}.

## Views of a Ratchet Tree {#views}

We generally assume that each participant maintains a complete and
up-to-date view of the public state of the group's ratchet tree,
including the public keys for all nodes and the credentials
associated with the leaf nodes.

No participant in an MLS group has full knowledge of the secret
state of the tree, i.e., private keys associated to
the nodes.  Instead, each member is assigned to a leaf of the tree,
which determines the set of secret state known to the member.  The
credential stored at that leaf is one provided by the member.

In particular, MLS maintains the members' views of the tree in such
a way as to maintain the _tree invariant_:

    The private key for a node in the tree is known to a member of
    the group if and only if that member's leaf is a descendant of
    the node or equal to it.

In other words, each member holds the private keys for nodes in its
direct path, and no others.

## Ratchet Tree Updates

Nodes in a tree are always updated along the direct path from a
leaf to the root.  The generator of the update chooses a random
secret value "path_secret[0]", and generates a sequence of "path
secrets", one for each node from the leaf to the root.  That is,
path_secret[0] is used for the leaf, path_secret[1] for its parent,
and so on.  At each step, the path secret is used to derive a new
secret value for the corresponding node, from which the node's key
pair is derived.

~~~~~
path_secret[n] = HKDF-Expand-Label(path_secret[n-1],
                                   "path", "", Hash.Length)
node_secret[n] = HKDF-Expand-Label(path_secret[n],
                                   "node", "", Hash.Length)
node_priv[n], node_pub[n] = Derive-Key-Pair(node_secret[n])
~~~~~

For example, suppose there is a group with four members:

~~~~~
      G
     / \
    /   \
   /     \
  E       F
 / \     / \
A   B   C   D
~~~~~

If the second participant (B) subsequently generates an update based on a
secret X, then the sender would generate the following sequence of
path secrets and node secrets:

~~~~~
    path_secret[2] ---> node_secret[2]
         ^
         |
    path_secret[1] ---> node_secret[1]
         ^
         |
X = path_secret[0] ---> node_secret[0]
~~~~~

After the update, the tree will have the following structure, where
"ns[i]" represents the node_secret values generated as described
above:

~~~~~
          ns[2]
         /     \
     ns[1]      F
     /  \      / \
    A   ns[0] C   D
~~~~~

## Synchronizing Views of the Tree

The members of the group need to keep their views of the tree in
sync and up to date.  When a client proposes a change to the tree
(e.g., to add or remove a member), it transmits a handshake message
containing a set of public
values for intermediate nodes in the direct path of a leaf. The
other members of the group can use these public values to update
their view of the tree, aligning their copy of the tree to the
sender's.

To perform an update for a leaf, the sender broadcasts to the group
the following information for each node in the direct path of the
leaf, as well as the root:

* The public key for the node
* Zero or more encrypted copies of the path secret corresponding to
  the node

The path secret value for a given node is encrypted for the subtree
corresponding to the parent's non-updated child, i.e., the child
on the copath of the leaf node.
There is one encrypted path secret for each public key in the resolution
of the non-updated child.  In particular, for the leaf node, there
are no encrypted secrets, since a leaf node has no children.

The recipient of an update processes it with the following steps:

1. Compute the updated path secrets.
   * Identify a node in the direct path for which the local member
     is in the subtree of the non-updated child.
   * Identify a node in the resolution of the copath node for
     which this node has a private key.
   * Decrypt the path secret for the parent of the copath node using
     the private key from the resolution node.
   * Derive path secrets for ancestors of that node using the
     algorithm described above.
   * The recipient SHOULD verify that the received public keys agree
     with the public keys derived from the new node_secret values.
2. Merge the updated path secrets into the tree.
   * Replace the public keys for nodes on the direct path with the
     received public keys.
   * For nodes where an updated path secret was computed in step 1,
     compute the corresponding node secret and node key pair and
     replace the values stored at the node with the computed values.

For example, in order to communicate the example update described in
the previous section, the sender would transmit the following
values:

| Public Key | Ciphertext(s)                    |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------|
| pk(ns[2])  | E(pk(C), ps[2]), E(pk(D), ps[2]) |
| pk(ns[1])  | E(pk(A), ps[1])                  |
| pk(ns[0])  |                                  |

In this table, the value pk(X) represents the public key
derived from the node secret X.  The value E(K, S) represents
the public-key encryption of the path secret S to the
public key K.


# Cryptographic Objects

## Ciphersuites

Each MLS session uses a single ciphersuite that specifies the
following primitives to be used in group key computations:

* A hash function
* A Diffie-Hellman finite-field group or elliptic curve
* An AEAD encryption algorithm {{!RFC5116}}

The ciphersuite's Diffie-Hellman group is used to instantiate an HPKE
{{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}} instance for the purpose of public-key encryption.
The ciphersuite must specify an algorithm `Derive-Key-Pair` that maps octet
strings with length Hash.length to HPKE key pairs.

Ciphersuites are represented with the CipherSuite type. HPKE public keys
are opaque values in a format defined by the underlying Diffie-Hellman
protocol (see the Ciphersuites section of the HPKE specification for more
information):

~~~~~
enum {
    P256_SHA256_AES128GCM(0x0000),
    X25519_SHA256_AES128GCM(0x0001),
    (0xFFFF)
} CipherSuite;

opaque HPKEPublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
~~~~~

## Ciphersuites

### Curve25519, SHA-256, and AES-128-GCM

This ciphersuite uses the following primitives:

* Hash function: SHA-256
* AEAD: AES-128-GCM

When HPKE is used with this ciphersuite, it uses the following
algorithms:

* KEM: 0x0002 = DHKEM(Curve25519)
* KDF: 0x0001 = HKDF-SHA256
* AEAD: 0x0001 = AES-GCM-128

Given an octet string X, the private key produced by the
Derive-Key-Pair operation is SHA-256(X).  (Recall that any 32-octet
string is a valid Curve25519 private key.)  The corresponding public
key is X25519(SHA-256(X), 9).

Implementations SHOULD use the approach
specified in {{?RFC7748}} to calculate the Diffie-Hellman shared secret.
Implementations MUST check whether the computed Diffie-Hellman shared
secret is the all-zero value and abort if so, as described in
Section 6 of {{RFC7748}}.  If implementers use an alternative
implementation of these elliptic curves, they SHOULD perform the
additional checks specified in Section 7 of {{RFC7748}}

### P-256, SHA-256, and AES-128-GCM

This ciphersuite uses the following primitives:

* Hash function: SHA-256
* AEAD: AES-128-GCM

When HPKE is used with this ciphersuite, it uses the following
algorithms:

* KEM: 0x0001 = DHKEM(P-256)
* KDF: 0x0001 = HKDF-SHA256
* AEAD: 0x0001 = AES-GCM-128

Given an octet string X, the private key produced by the
Derive-Key-Pair operation is SHA-256(X), interpreted as a big-endian
integer.  The corresponding public key is the result of multiplying
the standard P-256 base point by this integer.

P-256 ECDH calculations (including parameter
and key generation as well as the shared secret calculation) are
performed according to {{IEEE1363}} using the ECKAS-DH1 scheme with the identity
map as key derivation function (KDF), so that the shared secret is the
x-coordinate of the ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point represented
as an octet string.  Note that this octet string (Z in IEEE 1363 terminology)
as output by FE2OSP, the Field Element to Octet String Conversion
Primitive, has constant length for any given field; leading zeros
found in this octet string MUST NOT be truncated.

(Note that this use of the identity KDF is a technicality.  The
complete picture is that ECDH is employed with a non-trivial KDF
because MLS does not directly use this secret for anything
other than for computing other secrets.)

Clients MUST validate remote public values by ensuring
that the point is a valid point on the elliptic curve.
The appropriate validation procedures are defined in Section 4.3.7
of {{X962}} and alternatively in Section 5.6.2.3 of {{keyagreement}}.
This process consists of three steps: (1) verify that the value is not
the point at infinity (O), (2) verify that for Y = (x, y) both integers
are in the correct interval, (3) ensure that (x, y) is a correct solution
to the elliptic curve equation. For these curves, implementers do
not need to verify membership in the correct subgroup.

## Credentials

A member of a group authenticates the identities of other
participants by means of credentials issued by some authentication
system, e.g., a PKI.  Each type of credential MUST express the
following data:

* The public key of a signature key pair
* The identity of the holder of the private key
* The signature scheme that the holder will use to sign MLS messages

Credentials MAY also include information that allows a relying party
to verify the identity / signing key binding.

~~~~~
enum {
    basic(0),
    x509(1),
    (255)
} CredentialType;

struct {
    opaque identity<0..2^16-1>;
    SignatureScheme algorithm;
    SignaturePublicKey public_key;
} BasicCredential;

struct {
    CredentialType credential_type;
    select (Credential.credential_type) {
        case basic:
            BasicCredential;

        case x509:
            opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;
    };
} Credential;
~~~~~

The SignatureScheme type represents a signature algorithm. Signature public
keys are opaque values in a format defined by the signature scheme.

~~~~~
enum {
    ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256(0x0403),
    ed25519(0x0807),
    (0xFFFF)
} SignatureScheme;

opaque SignaturePublicKey<1..2^16-1>;
~~~~~

## Tree Hashes

To allow group members to verify that they agree on the
cryptographic state of the group, this section defines a scheme for
generating a hash value that represents the contents of the group's
ratchet tree and the members' credentials.

The hash of a tree is the hash of its root node, which we define
recursively, starting with the leaves.  The hash of a leaf node is
the hash of a `LeafNodeHashInput` object:

~~~~~
struct {
    uint8 present;
    switch (present) {
        case 0: struct{};
        case 1: T value;
    }
} optional<T>;

struct {
    HPKEPublicKey public_key;
    Credential credential;
} LeafNodeInfo;

struct {
    uint8 hash_type = 0;
    optional<LeafNodeInfo> info;
} LeafNodeHashInput;
~~~~~

The `public_key` and `credential` fields represent the leaf public
key and the credential for the member holding that leaf,
respectively.  The `info` field is equal to the null optional value
when the leaf is blank (i.e., no member occupies that leaf).

Likewise, the hash of a parent node (including the root) is the hash
of a `ParentNodeHashInput` struct:

~~~~~
struct {
    uint8 hash_type = 1;
    optional<HPKEPublicKey> public_key;
    opaque left_hash<0..255>;
    opaque right_hash<0..255>;
} ParentNodeHashInput;
~~~~~

The `left_hash` and `right_hash` fields hold the hashes of the
node's left and right children, respectively.  The `public_key`
field holds the hash of the public key stored at this node,
represented as an `optional<HPKEPublicKey>` object, which is null if
and only if the node is blank.

## Group State

Each member of the group maintains a GroupContext object that
summarizes the state of the group:

~~~~~
struct {
    opaque group_id<0..255>;
    uint32 epoch;
    opaque tree_hash<0..255>;
    opaque confirmed_transcript_hash<0..255>;
} GroupContext;
~~~~~

The fields in this state have the following semantics:

* The `group_id` field is an application-defined identifier for the
  group.
* The `epoch` field represents the current version of the group key.
* The `tree_hash` field contains a commitment to the contents of the
  group's rachet tree and the credentials for the members of the
  group, as described in {{tree-hashes}}.
* The `confirmed_transcript_hash` field contains a running hash over
  the handshake messages that led to this state.

When a new member is added to the group, an existing member of the
group provides the new member with a Welcome message.  The Welcome
message provides the information the new member needs to initialize
its GroupContext.

Different group operations will have different effects on the group
state.  These effects are described in their respective subsections
of {{handshake-messages}}.  The following rules apply to all
operations:

* The `group_id` field is constant
* The `epoch` field increments by one for each GroupOperation that
  is processed
* The `tree_hash` is updated to represent the current tree and
  credentials
* The `confirmed_transcript_hash` is updated with the data for an
  MLSPlaintext message encoding a group operation in two parts:

~~~~~
struct {
  opaque group_id<0..255>;
  uint32 epoch;
  uint32 sender;
  ContentType content_type = handshake;
  GroupOperation operation;
} MLSPlaintextOpContent;

struct {
  opaque confirmation<0..255>;
  opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
} MLSPlaintextOpAuthData;

confirmed_transcript_hash_[n] =
    Hash(interim_transcript_hash_[n-1] ||
         MLSPlaintextOpContent_[n]);

interim_transcript_hash_[n] =
    Hash(confirmed_transcript_hash_[n] ||
         MLSPlaintextOpAuthData_[n]);
~~~~~

This structure incorporates everything in an MLSPlaintext up to the
confirmation field in the transcript that is included in that
confirmation field (via the GroupContext).  The confirmation and
signature fields are then included in the transcript for the next
operation.  The interim transcript hash is passed to new members in
the WelcomeInfo struct, and enables existing members to incorporate
a handshake message into the transcript without having to store the
whole MLSPlaintextOpAuthData structure.

When a new one-member group is created (which requires no
GroupOperation), the `interim_transcript_hash` field is set to the
zero-length octet string.

## Direct Paths

As described in {{ratchet-tree-updates}}, each MLS message needs to
transmit node values along the direct path of a leaf.
The path contains a public key for the leaf node, and a
public key and encrypted secret value for intermediate nodes in the
path.  In both cases, the path is ordered from the leaf to the root;
each node MUST be the parent of its predecessor.

~~~~~
struct {
    opaque kem_output<0..2^16-1>;
    opaque ciphertext<0..2^16-1>;
} HPKECiphertext;

struct {
    HPKEPublicKey public_key;
    HPKECiphertext encrypted_path_secret<0..2^16-1>;
} DirectPathNode;

struct {
    DirectPathNode nodes<0..2^16-1>;
} DirectPath;
~~~~~

The length of the `encrypted_path_secret` vector MUST be zero for the first
node in the path.  For the remaining elements in the vector, the
number of ciphertexts in the `encrypted_path_secret` vector MUST be equal to
the length of the resolution of the corresponding copath node.  Each
ciphertext in the list is the encryption to the corresponding node
in the resolution.

The HPKECiphertext values are computed as

~~~~~
kem_output, context = SetupBaseI(node_public_key, "")
ciphertext = context.Seal("", path_secret)
~~~~~

where `node_public_key` is the public key of the node that the path
secret is being encrypted for, and the functions `SetupBaseI` and
`Seal` are defined according to {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.

Decryption is performed in the corresponding way, using the private
key of the resolution node and the ephemeral public key
transmitted in the message.

## Key Schedule

Group keys are derived using the HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand
functions as defined in {{!RFC5869}}, as well as the functions
defined below:

~~~~~
HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Context, Length) =
    HKDF-Expand(Secret, HkdfLabel, Length)

Where HkdfLabel is specified as:

struct {
  opaque group_context<0..255> = Hash(GroupContext_[n]);
  uint16 length = Length;
  opaque label<7..255> = "mls10 " + Label;
  opaque context<0..2^32-1> = Context;
} HkdfLabel;

Derive-Secret(Secret, Label) =
    HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, "", Hash.length)
~~~~~

The Hash function used by HKDF is the ciphersuite hash algorithm.
Hash.length is its output length in bytes.  In the below diagram:

* HKDF-Extract takes its salt argument from the top and its IKM
  argument from the left
* Derive-Secret takes its Secret argument from the incoming arrow

When processing a handshake message, a client combines the
following information to derive new epoch secrets:

* The init secret from the previous epoch
* The update secret for the current epoch
* The GroupContext object for current epoch

Given these inputs, the derivation of secrets for an epoch
proceeds as shown in the following diagram:

~~~~~
               init_secret_[n-1] (or 0)
                     |
                     V
update_secret -> HKDF-Extract = epoch_secret
                     |
                     +--> Derive-Secret(., "sender data", GroupContext_[n])
                     |    = sender_data_secret
                     |
                     +--> Derive-Secret(., "handshake", GroupContext_[n])
                     |    = handshake_secret
                     |
                     +--> Derive-Secret(., "app", GroupContext_[n])
                     |    = application_secret
                     |
                     +--> Derive-Secret(., "confirm", GroupContext_[n])
                     |    = confirmation_key
                     |
                     V
               Derive-Secret(., "init", GroupContext_[n])
                     |
                     V
               init_secret_[n]
~~~~~

## Encryption Keys

As described in {{message-framing}}, MLS encrypts three different
types of information:

* Metadata (sender information)
* Handshake messages
* Application messages

The sender information used to look up the key for the content encryption
is encrypted under AEAD using a random nonce and the sender_data_key
which is derived from the sender_data_secret as follows:

~~~~~
sender_data_key =
    HKDF-Expand-Label(sender_data_secret, "sd key", "", key_length)
~~~~~

Each handshake message is encrypted using a key and a nonce derived
from the handshake_secret for a specific sender to prevent two senders
to perform in the following way:

~~~~~
handshake_nonce_[sender] =
    HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "hs nonce", [sender], nonce_length)

handshake_key_[sender] =
    HKDF-Expand-Label(handshake_secret, "hs key", [sender], key_length)
~~~~~

Here the value [sender] represents the index of the member that will
use this key to send, encoded as a uint32.

For application messages, a chain of keys is derived for each sender
in a similar fashion. This allows forward secrecy at the level of
application messages within and out of an epoch.
A step in this chain (the second subscript) is called a "generation".
The details of application key derivation are described in the
{{astree}} section below.

# Initialization Keys

In order to facilitate asynchronous addition of clients to a
group, it is possible to pre-publish initialization keys that
provide some public information about a user. ClientInitKey
messages provide information about a client that any existing
member can use to add this client to the group asynchronously.

A ClientInitKey object specifies a ciphersuite that the client
supports, as well as providing a public key that others can use
for key agreement. The client's identity key is intended to be
stable throughout the lifetime of the group; there is no mechanism to
change it.  Init keys are intended to be used a very limited number of
times, ideally only once. (See {{init-key-reuse}}). Clients MAY
generate and publish multiple ClientInitKey objects to support multiple
ciphersuites, or to reduce the likelihood of init key reuse.
ClientInitKeys contain an identifier chosen by the client, which the
client MUST ensure uniquely identifies a given ClientInitKey object
among the set of ClientInitKeys created by this client.

The value for init\_key MUST be a public key for the asymmetric
encryption scheme defined by cipher\_suite. The whole structure
is signed using the client's identity key. A ClientInitKey object
with an invalid signature field MUST be considered malformed.
The input to the signature computation comprises all of the fields
except for the signature field.

~~~~~
enum {
    mls10(0),
    (255)
} ProtocolVersion;

struct {
    ProtocolVersion supported_version;
    opaque client_init_key_id<0..255>;
    CipherSuite cipher_suite;
    HPKEPublicKey init_key;
    Credential credential;
    opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
} ClientInitKey;
~~~~~


# Message Framing

Handshake and application messages use a common framing structure.
This framing provides encryption to ensure confidentiality within the
group, as well as signing to authenticate the sender within the group.

The two main structures involved are MLSPlaintext and MLSCiphertext.
MLSCiphertext represents a signed and encrypted message, with
protections for both the content of the message and related
metadata.  MLSPlaintext represents a message that is only signed,
and not encrypted.  Applications SHOULD use MLSCiphertext to encode
both application and handshake messages, but MAY transmit handshake
messages encoded as MLSPlaintext objects in cases where it is
necessary for the delivery service to examine such messages.

~~~~~
enum {
    invalid(0),
    handshake(1),
    application(2),
    (255)
} ContentType;

struct {
    opaque group_id<0..255>;
    uint32 epoch;
    uint32 sender;
    ContentType content_type;

    select (MLSPlaintext.content_type) {
        case handshake:
            GroupOperation operation;
            opaque confirmation<0..255>;

        case application:
            opaque application_data<0..2^32-1>;
    }

    opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
} MLSPlaintext;

struct {
    opaque group_id<0..255>;
    uint32 epoch;
    ContentType content_type;
    opaque sender_data_nonce<0..255>;
    opaque encrypted_sender_data<0..255>;
    opaque ciphertext<0..2^32-1>;
} MLSCiphertext;
~~~~~

The remainder of this section describes how to compute the signature of
an MLSPlaintext object and how to convert it to an MLSCiphertext object.
The overall process is as follows:

* Gather the required metadata:
  * Group ID
  * Epoch
  * Content Type
  * Nonce
  * Sender index
  * Key generation

* Sign the plaintext metadata -- the group ID, epoch, sender index, and
  content type -- as well as the message content

* Randomly generate sender_data_nonce and encrypt the sender information
  using it and the key derived from the sender_data_secret

* Encrypt the content using a content encryption key identified by
  the metadata

The group identifier, epoch and content_type fields are copied from
the MLSPlaintext object directly.
The content encryption process populates the ciphertext field of the
MLSCiphertext object.  The metadata encryption step populates the
encrypted_sender_data field.

Decryption follows the same step in reverse: Decrypt the
metadata, then the message and verify the content signature.

## Metadata Encryption

The "sender data" used to look up the key for the content encryption
is encrypted under AEAD using the MLSCiphertext sender_data_nonce and
the sender_data_key from the keyschedule. It is encoded as an
object of the following form:

~~~~~
struct {
    uint32 sender;
    uint32 generation;
} MLSSenderData;
~~~~~

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for the SenderData ciphertext
computation is its prefix in the MLSCiphertext, namely:

~~~~~
struct {
    opaque group_id<0..255>;
    uint32 epoch;
    ContentType content_type;
    opaque sender_data_nonce<0..255>;
} MLSCiphertextSenderDataAAD;
~~~~~

When parsing a SenderData struct as part of message decryption, the
recipient MUST verify that the sender field represents an occupied
leaf in the ratchet tree.  In particular, the sender index value
MUST be less than the number of leaves in the tree.

## Content Signing and Encryption

The signature field in an MLSPlaintext object is computed using the
signing private key corresponding to the credential at the leaf in
the tree indicated by the sender field.  The signature covers the
plaintext metadata and message content, i.e., all fields of
MLSPlaintext except for the `signature` field.

The ciphertext field of the MLSCiphertext object is produced by
supplying the inputs described below to the AEAD function specified
by the ciphersuite in use.  The plaintext input contains content and
signature of the MLSPlaintext, plus optional padding.  These values
are encoded in the following form:

~~~~~
struct {
    select (MLSCiphertext.content_type) {
        case handshake:
            GroupOperation operation;
            opaque confirmation<0..255>;

        case application:
            opaque application_data<0..2^32-1>;
    }

    opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
    opaque padding<0..2^16-1>;
} MLSCiphertextContent;
~~~~~

The key and nonce used for the encryption of the message depend on the
content type of the message.  The sender chooses the handshake key for a
handshake message or an ununsed generation from its (per-sender)
application key chain for the current epoch, according to the type
of message being encrypted.

The Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) input to the encryption
contains an object of the following form, with the values used to
identify the key and nonce:

~~~~~
struct {
    opaque group_id<0..255>;
    uint32 epoch;
    ContentType content_type;
    opaque sender_data_nonce<0..255>;
    opaque encrypted_sender_data<0..255>;
} MLSCiphertextContentAAD;
~~~~~

The ciphertext field of the MLSCiphertext object is produced by
supplying these inputs to the AEAD function specified by the
ciphersuite in use.


# Handshake Messages

Over the lifetime of a group, its state will change for:

* Group initialization
* A member adding a new client
* A member updating its leaf key
* A member deleting another member

In MLS, these changes are accomplished by broadcasting "handshake"
messages to the group.  Note that unlike TLS and DTLS, there is not
a consolidated handshake phase to the protocol.  Rather, handshake
messages are exchanged throughout the lifetime of a group, whenever
a change is made to the group state. This means an unbounded number
of interleaved application and handshake messages.

An MLS handshake message encapsulates a specific GroupOperation
message that accomplishes a change to the group state.  It is carried in
an MLSPlaintext message that provides a signature by the sender of the
message.  Applications may choose to send handshake messages in
encrypted form, as MLSCiphertext messages.

~~~~~
enum {
    init(0),
    add(1),
    update(2),
    remove(3),
    (255)
} GroupOperationType;

struct {
    GroupOperationType msg_type;
    select (GroupOperation.msg_type) {
        case init:      Init;
        case add:       Add;
        case update:    Update;
        case remove:    Remove;
    };
} GroupOperation;
~~~~~

The high-level flow for processing a handshake message is as
follows:

1. If the handshake message is encrypted (i.e., encoded as an
   MLSCiphertext object), decrypt it following the procedures
   described in {{message-framing}}.

2. Verify that the `epoch` field of enclosing MLSPlaintext message
   is equal the `epoch` field of the current GroupContext object.

3. Verify that the signature on the MLSPlaintext message verifies
   using the public key from the credential stored at the leaf in
   the tree indicated by the `sender` field.

4. Use the `operation` message to produce an updated, provisional
   GroupContext object incorporating the proposed changes.

5. Use the `confirmation_key` for the new epoch to compute the
   confirmation MAC for this message, as described below, and verify
   that it is the same as the `confirmation` field in the
   MLSPlaintext object.

6. If the the above checks are successful, consider the updated
   GroupContext object as the current state of the group.

The confirmation value confirms that the members of the group have
arrived at the same state of the group:

~~~~~
MLSPlaintext.confirmation =
    HMAC(confirmation_key, GroupContext.transcript_hash)
~~~~~

HMAC {{!RFC2104}} uses the Hash algorithm for the ciphersuite in
use.  Sign uses the signature algorithm indicated by the signer's
credential.

[[ OPEN ISSUE: It is not possible for the recipient of a handshake
message to verify that ratchet tree information in the message is
accurate, because each node can only compute the secret and private
key for nodes in its direct path.  This creates the possibility
that a malicious participant could cause a denial of service by sending a
handshake message with invalid values for public keys in the ratchet
tree. ]]

## Init

A group can always be created by initializing a one-member group and
using adding members individually.  For cases where the initial list
of members is known, the Init message allows a group to be created
more efficiently.

~~~~~
struct {
  opaque group_id<0..255>;
  ProtocolVersion version;
  CipherSuite cipher_suite;
  ClientInitKey members<0..2^32-1>;
  DirectPath path;
} Init;
~~~~~

The creator of the group constructs an Init message as follows:

* Fetch one or more ClientInitKeys for each member (including the creator)
* Identify a protocol version and ciphersuite that is supported by
  all proposed members.
* Construct a ratchet tree with its leaves populated with the public
  keys and credentials from the ClientInitKeys of the members, and all
  other nodes blank.
* Generate a fresh leaf key pair for the first leaf
* Compute its direct path in this ratchet tree

Each member of the newly-created group initializes its state from
the Init message as follows:

* Note the group ID, protocol version, and ciphersuite in use
* Construct a ratchet tree as above
* Update the cached ratchet tree by replacing nodes in the direct
  path from the first leaf using the direct path
* Update the cached ratchet tree by replacing nodes in the direct
  path from the first leaf using the information contained in the
  "path" attribute

The update secret for this interaction, used with an all-zero init
secret to generate the first epoch secret, is the `path_secret[i+1]`
derived from the `path_secret[i]` associated to the root node.  The
members learn the relevant path secrets by decrypting one of the
encrypted path secrets in the DirectPath and working back to the
root (as in normal DirectPath processing).

[[ OPEN ISSUE: This approach leaks the initial contents of the tree
to the Delivery Service, unlike the sequential-Add case. ]]

[[ OPEN ISSUE: It might be desireable for the group creator to be
able to "pre-warm" the tree, by providing values for some nodes not
on its direct path.  This would violate the tree invariant, so we
would need to figure out what mitigations would be necessary. ]]

## Add

In order to add a new member to the group, an existing member of the
group must take two actions:

1. Send a Welcome message to the new member
2. Send an Add message to the group (including the new member)

The Welcome message contains the information that the new member
needs to initialize a GroupContext object that can be updated to the
current state using the Add message.  This information is encrypted
for the new member using HPKE.  The recipient key pair for the
HPKE encryption is the one included in the indicated ClientInitKey.
The "add_key_nonce" field contains the key and nonce used to encrypt
the corresponding Add message; if it is not encrypted, then this
field MUST be set to the null optional value.

~~~~~
struct {
    HPKEPublicKey public_key;
    optional<Credential> credential;
} RatchetNode;

struct {
    opaque key<0..255>;
    opaque nonce<0..255>;
} KeyAndNonce;

struct {
    ProtocolVersion version;
    opaque group_id<0..255>;
    uint32 epoch;
    optional<RatchetNode> tree<1..2^32-1>;
    opaque interim_transcript_hash<0..255>;
    opaque init_secret<0..255>;
    optional<KeyAndNonce> add_key_nonce;
} WelcomeInfo;

struct {
    opaque client_init_key_id<0..255>;
    HPKECiphertext encrypted_welcome_info;
} Welcome;
~~~~~

In the description of the tree as a list of nodes, the `credential`
field for a node MUST be populated if and only if that node is a
leaf in the tree.

Note that the `init_secret` in the Welcome message is the
`init_secret` at the output of the key schedule diagram in
{{key-schedule}}.  That is, if the `epoch` value in the Welcome
message is `n`, then the `init_secret` value is `init_secret_[n]`.
The new member can combine this init secret with the update secret
transmitted in the corresponding Add message to get the epoch secret
for the epoch in which it is added.  No secrets from prior epochs
are revealed to the new member.

Since the new member is expected to process the Add message for
itself, the Welcome message should reflect the state of the group
before the new user is added. The sender of the Welcome message can
simply copy all fields from their GroupContext object.

[[ OPEN ISSUE: The Welcome message needs to be synchronized in the
same way as the Add.  That is, the Welcome should be sent only if
the Add succeeds, and is not in conflict with another, simultaneous
Add. ]]

An Add message provides existing group members with the information
they need to update their GroupContext with information about the new
member:

~~~~~
struct {
    uint32 index;
    ClientInitKey init_key;
    opaque welcome_info_hash<0..255>;
} Add;
~~~~~

The `index` field indicates where in the tree the new member should
be added.  The new member can be added at an existing, blank leaf
node, or at the right edge of the tree.  In any case, the `index`
value MUST satisfy `0 <= index <= n`, where `n` is the size of the
group. The case `index = n` indicates an add at the right edge of
the tree).  If `index < n` and the leaf node at position `index` is
not blank, then the recipient MUST reject the Add as malformed.

The `welcome_info_hash` field contains a hash of the WelcomeInfo
object sent in a Welcome message to the new member.

A group member generates this message by requesting a ClientInitKey
from the directory for the user to be added, and encoding it into an
Add message.

The client joining the group processes Welcome and Add
messages together as follows:

* Prepare a new GroupContext object based on the Welcome message
* Process the Add message as an existing member would

An existing member receiving a Add message first verifies
the signature on the message,  then updates its state as follows:

* If the `index` value is equal to the size of the group, increment
  the size of the group, and extend the tree accordingly
* Verify the signature on the included ClientInitKey; if the signature
  verification fails, abort
* Generate a WelcomeInfo object describing the state prior to the
  add, and verify that its hash is the same as the value of the
  `welcome_info_hash` field
* Update the ratchet tree by setting to blank all nodes in the
  direct path of the new node
* Set the leaf node in the tree at position `index` to a new node
  containing the public key from the ClientInitKey in the Add, as
  well as the credential under which the ClientInitKey was signed

The `update_secret` resulting from this change is an all-zero octet
string of length Hash.length.

After processing an Add message, the new member SHOULD send an Update
immediately to update its key. This will help to limit the tree structure
degrading into subtrees, and thus maintain the protocol's efficiency.

## Update

An Update message is sent by a group member to update its leaf
secret and key pair.  This operation provides post-compromise security
with regard to the member's prior leaf private key.

~~~~~
struct {
    DirectPath path;
} Update;
~~~~~

The sender of an Update message creates it in the following way:

* Generate a fresh leaf key pair
* Compute its direct path in the current ratchet tree

A member receiving a Update message first verifies
the signature on the message, then updates its state as follows:

* Update the cached ratchet tree by replacing nodes in the direct
  path from the updated leaf using the information contained in the
  Update message

The `update_secret` resulting from this change is the `path_secret[i+1]`
derived from the `path_secret[i]` associated to the root node.

## Remove

A Remove message is sent by a group member to remove one or more other
members from the group. A member MUST NOT use a Remove message to
remove themselves from the group. If a member of a group receives a
Remove message where the removed index is equal to the signer index,
the recipient MUST reject the message as malformed.

~~~~~
struct {
    uint32 removed;
    DirectPath path;
} Remove;
~~~~~

The sender of a Remove message generates it as as follows:

* Blank the path from the removed leaf to the root node for
  the time of the computation
* Truncate the tree such that the rightmost non-blank leaf is the
  last node of the tree, for the time of the computation
* Generate a fresh leaf key pair
* Compute its direct path in the current ratchet tree, starting from
  the sender's leaf

A member receiving a Remove message first verifies
the signature on the message.  The member then updates its
state as follows:

* Update the ratchet tree by setting to blank all nodes in the
  direct path of the removed leaf, and also setting the root node
  to blank
* Truncate the tree such that the rightmost non-blank leaf is the
  last node of the tree
* Update the ratchet tree by replacing nodes in the direct
  path from the sender's leaf using the information in the Remove message

Note that there must be at least one non-null element in
the tree, since any valid GroupContext must have the current member in
the tree and self-removal is prohibited

The `update_secret` resulting from this change is the `path_secret[i+1]`
derived from the `path_secret[i]` associated to the root node.


# Sequencing of State Changes {#sequencing}

[[ OPEN ISSUE: This section has an initial set of considerations
regarding sequencing.  It would be good to have some more detailed
discussion, and hopefully have a mechanism to deal with this issue. ]]

Each handshake message is premised on a given starting state,
indicated in its `prior_epoch` field.  If the changes implied by a
handshake messages are made starting from a different state, the
results will be incorrect.

This need for sequencing is not a problem as long as each time a
group member sends a handshake message, it is based on the most
current state of the group.  In practice, however, there is a risk
that two members will generate handshake messages simultaneously,
based on the same state.

When this happens, there is a need for the members of the group to
deconflict the simultaneous handshake messages.  There are two
general approaches:

* Have the delivery service enforce a total order
* Have a signal in the message that clients can use to break ties

As long as handshake messages cannot be merged, there is a risk of
starvation.  In a sufficiently busy group, a given member may never
be able to send a handshake message, because he always loses to other
members.  The degree to which this is a practical problem will depend
on the dynamics of the application.

It might be possible, because of the non-contributivity of intermediate
nodes, that update messages could be applied one after the other
without the Delivery Service having to reject any handshake message,
which would make MLS more resilient regarding the concurrency of
handshake messages.
The Messaging system can decide to choose the order for applying
the state changes. Note that there are certain cases (if no total
ordering is applied by the Delivery Service) where the ordering is
important for security, ie. all updates must be executed before
removes.

Regardless of how messages are kept in sequence, implementations
MUST only update their cryptographic state when valid handshake
messages are received.
Generation of handshake messages MUST be stateless, since the
endpoint cannot know at that time whether the change implied by
the handshake message will succeed or not.

## Server-Enforced Ordering

With this approach, the delivery service ensures that incoming
messages are added to an ordered queue and outgoing messages are
dispatched in the same order. The server is trusted to resolve
conflicts during race-conditions (when two members send a message
at the same time), as the server doesn't have any additional
knowledge thanks to the confidentiality of the messages.

Messages should have a counter field sent in clear-text that can
be checked by the server and used for tie-breaking. The counter
starts at 0 and is incremented for every new incoming message.
If two group members send a message with the same counter, the
first message to arrive will be accepted by the server and the
second one will be rejected. The rejected message needs to be sent
again with the correct counter number.

To prevent counter manipulation by the server, the counter's
integrity can be ensured by including the counter in a signed
message envelope.

This applies to all messages, not only state changing messages.

## Client-Enforced Ordering

Order enforcement can be implemented on the client as well,
one way to achieve it is to use a two step update protocol: the
first client sends a proposal to update and the proposal is
accepted when it gets 50%+ approval from the rest of the group,
then it sends the approved update. Clients which didn't get
their proposal accepted, will wait for the winner to send their
update before retrying new proposals.

While this seems safer as it doesn't rely on the server, it is
more complex and harder to implement. It also could cause starvation
for some clients if they keep failing to get their proposal accepted.

## Merging Updates

It is possible in principle to partly address the problem
of concurrent changes by having the recipients of the changes merge
them, rather than having the senders retry.  Because the value of
intermediate node is determined by its last updated child,
updates can be merged
by recipients as long as the recipients agree on an order -- the
only question is which node was last updated.

Recall that the processing of an update proceeds in two steps:

1. Compute updated secret values by hashing up the tree
2. Update the tree with the new secret and public values

To merge an ordered list of updates, a recipient simply performs
these updates in the specified order.

For example, suppose we have a tree in the following configuration:

~~~~~
     KDF(KDF(D))
     /       \
  KDF(B)    KDF(D)
  /  \      /  \
 A    B    C    D
~~~~~

Now suppose B and C simultaneously decide to update to X and Y,
respectively.  They will send out updates of the following form:

~~~~~
  Update from B      Update from C
  =============      =============
      KDF(KDF(X))             KDF(KDF(Y))
     /                         \
  KDF(X)                        KDF(Y)
     \                         /
      X                       Y
~~~~~

Assuming that the ordering agreed by the group says that B's update
should be processed before C's, the other members in the group
will overwrite the root value for B with the root value from C, and
all arrive at the following state:

~~~~~
      KDF(KDF(Y))
     /       \
  KDF(X)    KDF(Y)
  /  \      /  \
 A    X    Y    D
~~~~~


# Application Messages

The primary purpose of the Handshake protocol is to provide an
authenticated group key exchange to clients. In order to protect
Application messages sent among the members of a group, the Application
secret provided by the Handshake key schedule is used to derive nonces
and encryption keys for the Message Protection Layer according to
the Application Key Schedule. That is, each epoch is equipped with
a fresh Application Key Schedule which consist of a tree of Application
Secrets as well as one symmetric ratchet per group member.

Each client maintains their own local copy of the Application Key
Schedule for each epoch during which they are a group member. They
derive new keys, nonces and secrets as needed while deleting old
ones as soon as they have been used.

Application messages MUST be protected with the Authenticated-Encryption
with Associated-Data (AEAD) encryption scheme associated with the
MLS ciphersuite using the common framing mechanism.
Note that "Authenticated" in this context does not mean messages are
known to be sent by a specific client but only from a legitimate
member of the group.
To authenticate a message from a particular member, signatures are
required. Handshake messages MUST use asymmetric signatures to strongly
authenticate the sender of a message.

## Tree of Application Secrets {#astree}

The application key schedule begins with the application secrets which
are arranged in an "Application Secret Tree" or AS Tree for short;
a left balanced binary tree with the same set of nodes and edges as
the epoch's ratchet tree. Each leaf in the AS Tree is associated with
the same group member as the corresponding leaf in the ratchet tree.
Nodes are also assigned an index according to their position in the
array representation of the tree (described in {{tree-math}}). If N
is a node index in the AS Tree then left(N) and right(N) denote the
children of N (if they exist).

Each node in the tree is assigned a secret. The root's secret is simply
the application_secret of that epoch. (See {{key-schedule}} for the
definition of application_secret.)

~~~~
astree_node_[root]_secret = application_secret
~~~~

The secret of any other node in the tree is derived from its parent's secret
using a call to Derive-App-Secret.

~~~~
Derive-App-Secret(Secret, Label, Node, Generation, Length) =
    HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, ApplicationContext, Length)

Where ApplicationContext is specified as:

struct {
    uint32 node = Node;
    uint32 generation = Generation;
} ApplicationContext;
~~~~

If N is a node index in the AS Tree then the secrets of the children
of N are defined to be:

~~~~
astree_node_[N]_secret
        |
        |
        +--> Derive-App-Secret(., "tree", left(N), 0, Hash.length)
        |    = astree_node_[left(N)]_secret
        |
        +--> Derive-App-Secret(., "tree", right(N), 0, Hash.length)
             = astree_node_[right(N)]_secret
~~~~

Note that fixing concrete values for GroupContext_[n] and application_secret
completely defines all secrets in the AS Tree.

## Sender Ratchets

The secret of a leaf in the AS Tree is used to initiate a symmetric hash
ratchet which generates a sequence of keys and nonces. The group member
assigned to that leaf uses the j-th key/nonce pair in the sequence to
encrypt (using the AEAD) the j-th message they send during that epoch.
In particular, each key/nonce pair MUST NOT be used to encrypt more
than one message.

More precisely, the initial secret of the ratchet for the group
member assigned to the leaf with node index N is simply the secret of
that leaf.

~~~~
application_[N]_[0]_secret = astree_node_[N]_secret
~~~~

Keys, nonces and secrets of ratchets are derived using
Derive-App-Secret. The context in a given call consists of the index
of the sender's leaf in the ratchet tree and the current position in
the ratchet.  In particular, the index of the sender's leaf in the
ratchet tree is the same as the index of the leaf in the AS Tree
used to initialize the sender's ratchet.

~~~~
application_[N]_[j]_secret
      |
      +--> Derive-App-Secret(., "app-nonce", N, j, AEAD.nonce_length)
      |    = application_[N]_[j]_nonce
      |
      +--> Derive-App-Secret(., "app-key", N, j, AEAD.key_length)
      |    = application_[N]_[j]_key
      |
      V
Derive-App-Secret(., "app-secret", N, j, Hash.length)
= application_[N]_[j+1]_secret
~~~~

Here, AEAD.nonce\_length and AEAD.key\_length denote the lengths
in bytes of the nonce and key for the AEAD scheme defined by
the ciphersuite.

## Deletion Schedule

It is important to delete all security sensitive values as soon as they are
_consumed_. A sensitive value S is said to be _consumed_ if

* S was used to encrypt or (successfully) decrypt a message, or if
* a key, nonce, or secret derived from S has been consumed. (This goes for
  values derived via Derive-Secret as well as HKDF-Expand-Label.)

Here, S may be the `init_secret`, `update_secret`, `epoch_secret`, `application_secret`
as well as any secret in the AS Tree or one of the ratchets.

As soon as a group member consumes a value they MUST immediately delete
(all representations of) that value. This is crucial to ensuring
Forward Secrecy for past messages. Members MAY keep unconsumed values around
for some reasonable amount of time even if their generating secret was
already consumed (e.g. due to out of order message delivery).

For example, suppose a group member encrypts or (successfully) decrypts a
message using the j-th key and nonce in the i-th ratchet. Then, for that
member, at least the following values have been consumed and MUST be deleted:

* the `init_secret`, `update_secret`, `epoch_secret`, `application_secret` of that
epoch,
* all node secrets in the AS Tree on the path from the root to the leaf with
index i,
* the first j secrets in the i-th ratchet and
* `application_[i]_[j]_key` and `application_[i]_[j]_nonce`.

Concretely, suppose we have the following AS Tree and ratchet for
participant D:

~~~
       G
     /   \
    /     \
   E       F
  / \     / \
A0  B0  C0  D0 -+- KD0
            |   |
            |   +- ND0
            |
            D1 -+- KD1
            |   |
            |   +- ND1
            |
            D2
~~~

Then if a client uses key KD1 and nonce ND1 during epoch n then it must consume
(at least) values G, F, D0, D1, KD1, ND1 as well as the update_secret and
init_secret used to derive G (i.e. the application_secret).  The
client MAY retain (i.e., not consume) the values KD0 and ND0 to
allow for out-of-order delivery, and SHOULD retain D2 to allow for
processing future messages.

## Further Restrictions {#further-restrictions}

During each epoch senders MUST NOT encrypt more data than permitted by the
security bounds of the AEAD scheme used.

Note that each change to the Group through a Handshake message will also set a
new application_secret. Hence this change MUST be applied before encrypting
any new Application message. This is required both to ensure that any users
removed from the group can no longer receive messages and to (potentially)
recover confidentiality and authenticity for future messages despite a past
state compromise.

[[ OPEN ISSUE: At the moment there is no contributivity of Application secrets
chained from the initial one to the next generation of Epoch secret. While this
seems safe because cryptographic operations using the application secrets can't
affect the group init_secret, it remains to be proven correct. ]]

## Message Encryption and Decryption

The group members MUST use the AEAD algorithm associated with
the negotiated MLS ciphersuite to AEAD encrypt and decrypt their
Application messages according to the Message Framing section.

The group identifier and epoch allow a recipient to know which group secrets
should be used and from which Epoch secret to start computing other secrets
and keys. The sender identifier is used to identify the member's
symmetric ratchet from the initial group Application secret. The application
generation field is used to determine how far into the ratchet to iterate in
order to reproduce the required AEAD keys and nonce for performing decryption.

Application messages SHOULD be padded to provide some resistance
against traffic analysis techniques over encrypted traffic.
{{?CLINIC=DOI.10.1007/978-3-319-08506-7_8}}
{{?HCJ16=DOI.10.1186/s13635-016-0030-7}}
While MLS might deliver the same payload less frequently across
a lot of ciphertexts than traditional web servers, it might still provide
the attacker enough information to mount an attack. If Alice asks Bob:
"When are we going to the movie ?" the answer "Wednesday" might be leaked
to an adversary by the ciphertext length. An attacker expecting Alice to
answer Bob with a day of the week might find out the plaintext by
correlation between the question and the length.

Similarly to TLS 1.3, if padding is used, the MLS messages MUST be
padded with zero-valued bytes before AEAD encryption. Upon AEAD decryption,
the length field of the plaintext is used to compute the number of bytes
to be removed from the plaintext to get the correct data.
As the padding mechanism is used to improve protection against traffic
analysis, removal of the padding SHOULD be implemented in a "constant-time"
manner at the MLS layer and above layers to prevent timing side-channels that
would provide attackers with information on the size of the plaintext.
The padding length length_of_padding can be chosen at the time of the message
encryption by the sender. Recipients can calculate the padding size from knowing
the total size of the ApplicationPlaintext and the length of the content.

[[ TODO: A preliminary formal security analysis has yet to be performed on
this authentication scheme.]]

[[ OPEN ISSUE: Currently, the group identifier, epoch and generation are
contained as meta-data of the Signature. A different solution could be to
include the GroupContext instead, if more information is required to achieve
the security goals regarding cross-group attacks. ]]

[[ OPEN ISSUE: Should the padding be required for handshake messages ?
Can an adversary get more than the position of a participant in the tree
without padding ? Should the base ciphertext block length be negotiated or
is is reasonable to allow to leak a range for the length of the plaintext
by allowing to send a variable number of ciphertext blocks ? ]]

## Delayed and Reordered Application messages

Since each Application message contains the group identifier, the epoch and a
message counter, a client can receive messages out of order.
If they are able to retrieve or recompute the correct AEAD decryption key
from currently stored cryptographic material clients can decrypt
these messages.

For usability, MLS clients might be required to keep the AEAD key
and nonce for a certain amount of time to retain the ability to decrypt
delayed or out of order messages, possibly still in transit while a
decryption is being done.

[[TODO: Describe here or in the Architecture spec the details. Depending
on which Secret or key is kept alive, the security guarantees will vary.]]


# Security Considerations

The security goals of MLS are described in [I-D.ietf-mls-architecture].
We describe here how the protocol achieves its goals at a high level,
though a complete security analysis is outside of the scope of this
document.

## Confidentiality of the Group Secrets

Group secrets are derived from (i) previous group secrets, and (ii)
the root key of a ratcheting tree. Only group members know their leaf
private key in the group, therefore, the root key of the group's ratcheting
tree is secret and thus so are all values derived from it.

Initial leaf keys are known only by their owner and the group creator,
because they are derived from an authenticated key exchange protocol.
Subsequent leaf keys are known only by their owner. [[TODO: or by
someone who replaced them.]]

Note that the long-term identity keys used by the protocol MUST be
distributed by an "honest" authentication service for clients to
authenticate their legitimate peers.

## Authentication

There are two forms of authentication we consider. The first form
considers authentication with respect to the group. That is, the group
members can verify that a message originated from one of the members
of the group. This is implicitly guaranteed by the secrecy of the
shared key derived from the ratcheting trees: if all members of the
group are honest, then the shared group key is only known to the group
members. By using AEAD or appropriate MAC with this shared key, we can
guarantee that a member in the group (who knows the shared secret
key) has sent a message.

The second form considers authentication with respect to the sender,
meaning the group members can verify that a message originated from a
particular member of the group. This property is provided by digital
signatures on the messages under identity keys.

[[ OPEN ISSUE: Signatures under the identity keys, while simple, have
the side-effect of preclude deniability. We may wish to allow other
options, such as (ii) a key chained off of the identity key,
or (iii) some other key obtained through a different manner, such
as a pairwise channel that provides deniability for the message
contents.]]

## Forward and post-compromise security

Message encryption keys are derived via a hash ratchet, which
provides a form of forward secrecy: learning a message key does not
reveal previous message or root keys. Post-compromise security is
provided by Update operations, in which a new root key is generated
from the latest ratcheting tree. If the adversary cannot derive the
updated root key after an Update operation, it cannot compute any
derived secrets.

## Init Key Reuse

Initialization keys are intended to be used only once and then
deleted. Reuse of init keys is not believed to be inherently insecure
{{dhreuse}}, although it can complicate protocol analyses.

# Tree Math {#tree-math}

One benefit of using left-balanced trees is that they admit a simple
flat array representation.  In this representation, leaf nodes are
even-numbered nodes, with the n-th leaf at 2\*n.  Intermediate nodes
are held in odd-numbered nodes.  For example, a 11-element tree has
the following structure:

~~~~~
                                             X
                     X
         X                       X                       X
   X           X           X           X           X
X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X     X
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
~~~~~

This allows us to compute relationships between tree nodes simply by
manipulating indices, rather than having to maintain complicated
structures in memory, even for partial trees. The basic
rule is that the high-order bits of parent and child nodes have the
following relation (where `x` is an arbitrary bit string):

~~~~~
parent=01x => left=00x, right=10x

The following python code demonstrates the tree computations
necessary for MLS.  Test vectors can be derived from the diagram
above.
